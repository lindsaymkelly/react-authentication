# Konica Minolta Assessment: Authentication Server

For my technical assessment, I chose to build the Authentication Server.  This application is built on React.js and was initially set up using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Other dependencies are as follows:

* [auth0-js](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react)
* [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)
* [jwt-decode](https://github.com/auth0/jwt-decode)
* react (version 15.6.1)
* react-dom
* [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
* react-scripts
* npm (version 5.3)

## To Use:

    git clone https://github.com/lindsaymkelly/react-authentication.git
    cd react-authentication
    npm install
    yarn start

More information about design decisions and project approach can be found once you login to the app!
